   The code is the exact rewriting of the cephes sinf function.
   Precision is excellent as long as x < 8192 (I did not bother to
   take into account the special handling they have for greater values
   -- it does not return garbage for arguments over 8192, though, but
   the extra precision is missing).

   Note that it is such that sinf((float)M_PI) = 8.74e-8, which is the
   surprising but correct result.

   Note also that when you compute sin(x), cos(x) is available at
   almost no extra price so both sin_ps and cos_ps make use of
   sincos_ps..
